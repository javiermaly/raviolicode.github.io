        Hi, I'm Lucia
        %strong Escanellas

      %p I'm a Software Engineer, crazy about software development, fan of tarsiers.
      %p

        My name is Lucia Escanellas, also known as raviolicode. I live in #{link_to 'Montevideo, Uruguay', '#'},
        working at Neo, and a member of #{link_to 'DATA', 'http://github.com/datauy'}.
      %p Engineer by profession, coder by choice, I believe in how doing "the right things the right way" can make a difference.
      %p I love solving problems in all their forms. Setting up servers, defining architectures, coaching teams in agile methodologies, coding a usable front-end.
      %p But above all, seeing a project's success is what really drives me.
      %p I have been fascinated by computers since I was 9, when there was only #{link_to "Xenix", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix"} and DOS.
      %p Started out as a Linux Sysadmin, and then a computer networks teacher at the University.
      %p I also worked as a .NET Developer / Analyst. Then I discovered Ruby, and I have been working on Web Development ever since :)</p>
